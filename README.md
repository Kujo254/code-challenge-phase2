# ðŸ“ˆ Smart Goal Planner

A React app that helps users create, track, and manage their financial goals.  
Users can add savings goals, make deposits toward them, see their progress, and get alerts when deadlines are close or overdue.  
The app fetches and saves data using a local `db.json` file served with `json-server`.
